## Rectangle Calculator

A simple Python project that calculates the **area** and **perimeter** of a rectangle. Built using everything I learned in Week 9 - functions, logic, and a little patience.

## What It Does

- Asks the user to enter the **length** and **width**
- Calculates:
  - Area = length * width
  - Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
- Returns the results with a friendly message

## What I Used

- Python functions to keep things neat
- User input and type conversion
- Simple math and print statements

## What I struggled With

I had a moment where I *seriously* overcomplicated things - I forgot the objective and did too much. But after stepping back, I simplified my logic and broke things down with functions. It worked like a charm.
